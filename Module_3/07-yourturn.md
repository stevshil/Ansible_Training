# Your Turn

For this practice we want you to work with templates, and configure the /etc/resolv.conf file so that all our servers use Google 8.8.8.8 and Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 as their nameservers.

Add the code to your **webservers.yml** and **databases.yml** that will provision the /etc/resolv.conf file to list these as the nameservers.

Add the template file to your **templates** directory and call it **etc_resolv.conf.j2**.

Requirements:

* Ansible **template** module
* Jinja2 **for** loop

Your final file should look like:

```
# This file is generated by Ansible do not edit

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1
```
